# UbiDesign Shower Study
This repo contains the resources required to construc the hardware and software required to deploy the UbiDesign shower study kit. It is currently under development and as such may drastically change

The kit is designed as a technology probe to investigate the potential utility of IoT shower data in the design manufacturing process as part of the UbiDesign Project - <http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N005945/1>

It consists of:
* A BLE shower products shelf
* A BLE shower head movement tracker
* A RF flow and temperature monitor
* A hub which collects, stores and makes available the data collected by the above sensors

For more information please refer to documents in the design protocol folder.
